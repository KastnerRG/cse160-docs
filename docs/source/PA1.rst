Programming Assignment 1 - Device Query
=======================================

******
Part 1
******

Objective
^^^^^^^^^
The purpose of this programming assignment is to familiarize the student with the underlying hardware and how it relates to the OpenCL hardware model.  By extension, the program will familiarize the student with the processing resources at hand along with their capabilities.  By the end of this assignment, one should understand the process of compiling and running code that will be used in subsequent modules.



Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The file :code:`main.c` queries for devices across all platforms, and displays information about each device.

Some properties to pay attention to:

* Computational Capabilities
* Global Memory Size
* Shared Memory Size
* Work Item Size
* Work Item Dimensions
* Work Group Size
* Preferred Work Group Size Multiple

The student is encouraged to relate the device-specific information to the OpenCL memory model, provided below.

How to Run
^^^^^^^^^^
The :code:`main.c` file contains the host code for the programming assignment; there is no associated device kernel code for this assignment. There is a Makefile included which compiles it. It can be run by typing :code:`make` from the DeviceQuery folder. It generates a :code:`device_query` output file.  Simply run this with :code:`./device_query`, which will print device information to the console.

Submission
^^^^^^^^^^
You do not need to submit any code for this assignment. You must answer the questions in Gradescope.

Part 2
******

Objective
^^^^^^^^^

The second part of this assignment aims to contextualize parallelization and demonstrate
the benefits of heterogenous programming.  With access to multiple processing cores, 
multiple threads can be assigned to operate on independent tasks of a program, 
allowing parallelized programs to have massive benefits over their sequential counterparts.

The goal of this part of the assignment is to demonstrate the visible speedup that 
arises from a program running on one thread, to a program running in parallel on slightly more 
threads, and finally to a program that runs in parallel on many threads.

Context 
^^^^^^^

For a visually appealing example, the program chosen to desmonstrate parallelization
is that of a **raytracer**.  We first explore the high level overview of raytracer functionality
to understand why parallelization is a natural application for this program.

The high level concept of raytracing is derived from the idea of shooting "rays" into 
a virtual world and seeing what these rays hit.  One can imagine an eye shooting out 
into the world and being able to see whatever the ray hits.  In the case of ray tracing,
we have a "camera" (i.e. the eye) that produces rays starting from the eye position and 
going through pixels in a 2D screen.

In the diagram above, the computer screen can be represented as a 2D grid of squares,
where each square represents a pixel on the screen.  A ray (labelled as primary ray) 
is shot from the position of the camera towards the center of the pixel. 

Such a ray is created for every pixel in the screen.  As such, the direction a ray goes
is determined by where the origin of the ray is (that is, where the eye is positioned) and
the coordinates of the pixel on the screen that the ray is shot through.  In other words,
*every primary ray is unique to the pixel it is sent through*.

On the other side of the screen is the virtual scene, composed of objects and lights.  
In the diagram above, we observe a singular object of a green sphere and a singular 
point light above it.

After the ray is created, it is sent into the virtual scene.  The purpose of the ray is
to probe the virtual scene.  The first object in the virtual scene that the ray 
hits, referred to as an *intersection*, determines what object is closest to the 
screen.  For simplicity, we first assume that the ray will simply track the first
object intersected.  As stated before, *every primary ray is unique to the pixel it is sent through*;
as such, we may draw the color of the object that was first intersected to the screen,
as an intersection of the object with the primary ray indicates that we can see the object.

In the diagram below, we can see that an intersection of a primary ray (referred to as a view ray in the below diagram) with the 
blue sphere in the scene results in blue being drawn to the pixel that the primary
ray goes through.  In other words, the job of a ray in a ray tracer is to simply probe
the scene to determine which color to draw at each pixel.

In a raytracer, a primary ray is drawn through every pixel.  As such, the psuedocode 
would look something like this:

::

  for x in image_width:
    for y in image_height:
      create ray through pixel (x, y)
      get color and display color on pixel (x, y)
  

And that's the (very) high level overview of how a raytracer works! 
Of course, there's a lot of processing and nested for-loops within
the process of getting a color (iterating through objects in a scene), 
all the lights, etc.).  So how does parallelization
fit into this?

Recall that a primary ray is a property of the pixel in the screen that it is sent through.
That is to say, every ray that is sent through a piel determines that pixel color independently!

The current implementation based on the psuedocode runs only on a single thread 
on one processor, and relies on nested for-loops to iterate through
every pixel in the screen.  What if we had multiple processors we could
use at once, thus producing multiple rays simultaneously?  

Thus, we can parallelize the generation of rays in a raytracer, an application of 
parallel computing so simple that it is considered **embarassingly parallel** :)

With the context out of the way, let's dive into the code!

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code for a basic raytracer has already been provided.  The goal of this part
is not to have you be able to write your own raytracer from scratch, but to understand
its overall structure and see how it can be parallelized.  By extension, to demonstrate
how effective parallelization can be!

Step 1:
+++++++

The first program to look at is in the ``raytracer_sequential`` directory.  Here, open up
``main.c``.  This is the implementation of a raytracer **for a single-threaded program
running on the CPU**.  Given that there is only one thread, the naive implementation of 
iterating through every pixel is used, resulting in a nested for loop.  Scan through this
code and understand where this for-loop is located and how it is used to determine
which pixel is being drawn to.

Step 2:
+++++++

Now, run the program using the command ``make run``.  This will compile the program
and generate an output file ``output.png``.  You can view this file to see a neat
little scene that the program generated!  You'll also notice in the terminal that 
the time it took for the program to run was also outputted.  **Note how much time the
sequential implemenation of the raytracer took**!  We'll see how our next implemenation
compares.

Step 3:
+++++++
Now that we have a benchmark performance of how long a sequential, single-threaded
implemenation of a raytracer on the CPU is, let's compare it with a parallelized 
implemenation!  You can find the kernel (the program meant to run on a compute device)
in the directory ``raytracer_kernel`` as a file titled ``kernel.cl``.  This is an 
OpenCL kernel.  Compare this with ``main.c`` in the sequential implementation; 
what do you notice (hint: what happened to the for-loop? Why might this be?).

Step 4:
+++++++
The kernel doesn't actually run by itself; instead, it needs to be built by 
some main program that will read the kernel program as a string and build
the correct context and command queues to map the kernel to a compute device
and run it.  This is done in ``main.c`` (the one in ``raytracer_kernel``, not to
be confused with the first ``main.c`` in ``raytracer_sequential``).

What's nice about kernels in OpenCL is that they can be mapped to any compute device (in theory),
whether that be a CPU, a GPU, even an FPGA. That's great for us! 
Depending on Operating system support, we can try running the kernel on a variety of devices.

Recall from Part 1 that each device that OpenCL recognizes on your computer is associated with an index.
Typically a computer will have a device for the GPU and may have a device for the GPU.
Try running the parallel raytracer on the devices available on your system with ``raytracer_parallel <device_index>``.

Recap
^^^^^

We have two programs:

* Sequential implementation (``main.c`` standalone in ``raytracer_sequential``)
* Kernel implementation (``main.c`` and ``kernel.cl`` in ``raytracer_kernel``)

The sequential implementation runs on a single thread on the CPU.

The Kernel implemenation will run on the GPU. Depending on your computer, it may also run on the CPU.
Depending on the device, the number of cores accessible (and thus the number of active threads) differs.  
This causes differences in performance; that is, the more threads we have access to, 
the greater the degree of parallelization.

From this example, you should have been able to witness firsthand the power of parallelization!
